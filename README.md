# Smart glove for healthcare monitoring system
 A smart glove for healthcare monitoring system is designed to empower patients and enhance healthcare by measuring vital signs like heartbeat, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation. It features an intuitive emergency signaling feature, allowing patients to perform specific hand movements using imu and flex sesnsors, instantly transmitting distress signals to a large screen and activating an alert. The glove combines technology and healthcare, providing peace of mind and control.
The project is equipped with those sensors:

1) 𝙄𝙈𝙐 𝙎𝙚𝙣𝙨𝙤𝙧: Detects the precise movements of the hand.

2) 𝙋𝙧𝙚𝙨𝙨𝙪𝙧𝙚 𝙎𝙚𝙣𝙨𝙤𝙧: Gauges the force exerted by the fingers, catering to those with limited mobility.

3) 𝙀𝘾𝙂 𝙎𝙚𝙣𝙨𝙤𝙧: Monitors the electrical activity of the heart for comprehensive cardiac health tracking.

4) 𝙋𝙪𝙡𝙨𝙚 𝙎𝙚𝙣𝙨𝙤𝙧: Also provides real-time heartbeat readings.

5) 𝙊𝙭𝙮𝙜𝙚𝙣 𝙎𝙖𝙩𝙪𝙧𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣 𝙎𝙚𝙣𝙨𝙤𝙧: Measures the oxygen levels in the blood, ensuring vital respiratory functions are within safe parameters.

This project is a testament to the fusion of technology and healthcare, offering peace of mind and control to those who need it most.
